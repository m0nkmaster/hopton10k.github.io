      <description>Latest preparations Short Road Closure There way still be three months to go before the Hopton10k but preparations are in full swing. We&amp;rsquo;ve had confirmation that we can temporarily close Calder Road, Granny Lane and Stenard Lane for twenty minutes between 10:00 and 10:20. This will allow the start of the race to be completely car free, I&amp;rsquo;d expect all runners to have entered the woods by 10:15.
Parking We have secured additional parking for around twenty cars at Lower Hopton WMC.</description>
