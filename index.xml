      <description>Latest preparations Short Road Closure There way still be three months to go before the Hopton10k but preparations are in full swing. We&amp;rsquo;ve had confirmation that we can temporarily close Calder Road, Granny Lane and Stenard Lane for twenty minutes between 10:00 and 10:20. This will allow the start of the race to be completely car free, I&amp;rsquo;d expect all runners to have entered the woods by 10:15.
Parking We have secured additional parking for around twenty cars at Lower Hopton WMC.</description>

      <description>Never take under kids on a 10k walk without snacks! Today I decided it was a &amp;lsquo;good idea&amp;rsquo; to take the whole family out to walk the Hopton 10k route.
It turns out the 10k undulating route feels a lot longer when you&amp;rsquo;re listening to kids complaining about being tired and carrying a toddler for 60% of the time.
However, we made it, and we picked several key areas to place marshals and signage.</description>
